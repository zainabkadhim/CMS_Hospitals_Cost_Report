<h2> The Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) Hospital cost Report from 2018 to 2022</h2>
<h3>Overview </h3>
<h4>The financial stability of hospitals plays a vital role in sustaining the delivery of quality healthcare. 
In the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, hospitals have faced unprecedented challenges that disrupted overall 
operations, increased costs, 
and labor strain. While emergency relief provided temporary support, the long-term 
effects of the pandemic have left many facilities struggling to maintain stability. The aim is to uncover actionable 
insights that can help the stability of healthcare system.</h4>
<h3>Problem Statment</h3>
<h4>According to CMS cost report, the median of hospital profits declined sharply by 72% from 2021 to 2022. 
This decline led to staffing shortages, rising costs and strained hospital operations. The CMS Office of the 
Actuary aims to identify the root cause of the median profits fluctuations and develop targeted strategies 
to stabilize hospital profits by the last quarter of 2025. </h4>
<h3> Objectives </h3>
<h4>1. How did the Median Profits change over the Years?</h4>

<h4>2. What is the distribution of Hospitals across Segments?</h4>

<h4>3. What is the distribution of Hospitals across Hospital Size?</h4>

<h4>4. What is the distribution of Hospitals across Facility Type?</h4>

<h4>5. What is the distribution of Total Profits across different Segments?</h4>

<h4>6. What is the distribution of Total Profits across different Hospital Size?</h4>

<h4>7. What is the distribution of Total Profits across different Facility Type?</h4>

<h4>8. Comparison between General Short-Term Hospitals & Other Hospitals:</h4>

<h4> - Profit over Years</h4>
<h4> - Total Cost and Total Revenue over Years</h4>
<h4> - Operational Costs and Additional Costs over Years</h4>
<h4> - Patient Revenue and Additional Revenue over Years</h4>
